# Final Project - Translation System

## This is the Final Project of the course Ruby Puro of One Bit Code School.

"Create a software that allows the user to enter a text, the language in wich the text is written and also the language for those who want to translate the text and show the translated text on the screen." 

## Acceptance Criteria

- the result of each translation (included the original sentence), must be kept in a file that has the translation date and time in the name (ex: 10-10-18_10: 30.txt).
